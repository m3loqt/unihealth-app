# Specialist Status Validation Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds validation to prevent specialists with "pending" status from logging into the application. The validation occurs at both the application level (auth service) and database level (Firebase rules).

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Service (`src/services/api/auth.ts`)

#### New Function: `checkSpecialistStatus`
- Checks if a specialist's status in the `doctors` node is "pending"
- Returns `false` if status is "pending", `true` otherwise
- Gracefully handles errors by allowing login (fail-safe approach)

#### Modified Function: `signIn`
- Added status validation for specialists during login
- Returns structured error object instead of throwing exceptions
- Only applies to users with role "specialist"
- Returns `{ success: boolean; userProfile?: UserProfile; error?: { type: string; message: string; suggestion?: string } }`

### 2. Firebase Rules (`firebase-rules.json`)

#### Updated Rules for Multiple Nodes:
- `doctors`: Specialists can only read their own data if status is pending
- `appointments`: Pending specialists cannot read/write appointments
- `prescriptions`: Pending specialists cannot read/write prescriptions
- `certificates`: Pending specialists cannot read/write certificates
- `referrals`: Pending specialists cannot read/write referrals
- `medical_history`: Pending specialists cannot read/write medical history

## How It Works

### Application Level Validation
1. User attempts to sign in
2. Firebase authentication succeeds
3. System retrieves user profile from database
4. If user role is "specialist", system checks status in `doctors` node
5. If status is "pending", login is denied with ErrorModal showing clear message and suggestion
6. If status is anything else (or undefined), login proceeds normally
7. Other errors are displayed as inline messages in the existing error area

### Database Level Validation
1. Firebase rules check specialist status before allowing data access
2. Pending specialists can only access their own profile data
3. All other data access is blocked for pending specialists

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Scenarios

#### 1. Approved Specialist Login
```javascript
// Specialist with status: "approved" or any non-pending value
// Expected: Login succeeds, full access granted
```

#### 2. Pending Specialist Login
```javascript
// Specialist with status: "pending"
// Expected: Login fails with message: "Your account is currently pending approval. Please contact support for assistance."
```

#### 3. New Specialist (No Status)
```javascript
// Specialist with no status field in doctors node
// Expected: Login succeeds (graceful handling for new specialists)
```

#### 4. Patient Login
```javascript
// User with role: "patient"
// Expected: Login succeeds, no status check performed
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a test specialist with pending status:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase console, add to doctors node:
   {
     "test-specialist-id": {
       "firstName": "Dr. Test",
       "lastName": "Specialist",
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "status": "pending",
       "userId": "test-specialist-id"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create corresponding user record:**
   ```javascript
   // In Firebase console, add to users node:
   {
     "test-specialist-id": {
       "email": "test@example.com",
       "firstName": "Dr. Test",
       "lastName": "Specialist",
       "role": "specialist",
       "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Test login attempt:**
   - Try to sign in with the test specialist credentials
   - Should receive error message about pending approval

4. **Update status to approved:**
   ```javascript
   // Change status from "pending" to "approved"
   ```

5. **Test login again:**
   - Should now succeed

### Error Messages

- **Pending Status:** Shows ErrorModal with title "Account Pending Approval" and suggestion to contact support
- **Other Errors:** Shows inline error messages in the existing error display area
- **Database Error:** Login proceeds normally (fail-safe approach)

## Security Considerations

1. **Fail-Safe Design:** Database errors allow login to prevent blocking legitimate users
2. **Multi-Layer Protection:** Both application and database level validation
3. **Descriptive Errors:** Clear error messages for users
4. **Admin Override:** Specialists can still access their own profile data even when pending

## Database Structure

### Doctors Node
```json
{
  "doctor-id": {
    "firstName": "Dr. John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "doctor@example.com",
    "status": "pending", // or "approved", "rejected", etc.
    "userId": "doctor-id",
    "specialty": "Cardiology",
    // ... other fields
  }
}
```

### Users Node
```json
{
  "user-id": {
    "email": "doctor@example.com",
    "firstName": "Dr. John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "role": "specialist",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Notes

1. **Firebase Rules:** Deploy updated rules to Firebase console
2. **Application Code:** Deploy updated authentication service
3. **Testing:** Verify with test accounts before production use
4. **Monitoring:** Monitor error logs for any authentication issues

## Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Panel:** Add interface for administrators to manage specialist status
2. **Status History:** Track status changes over time
3. **Email Notifications:** Notify specialists when status changes
4. **Bulk Operations:** Tools for managing multiple specialists at once

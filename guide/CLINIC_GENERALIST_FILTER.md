# Clinic Generalist Filter Implementation

## Overview
Modified the clinic booking flow to only show clinics that have generalist doctors available, and simplified the clinic display to show only essential information (address and contact number).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Service Updates

**File: `src/services/database/firebase.ts`**

#### New Method: `hasGeneralistDoctors`
```typescript
async hasGeneralistDoctors(clinicId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  // Checks if a clinic has any generalist doctors
  // Returns true if clinic has doctors with:
  // - isGeneralist === true
}
```

#### Modified Method: `getClinics`
- Now filters clinics to only include those with generalist doctors
- Maintains existing address validation
- Returns only clinics that have at least one generalist doctor

#### Modified Method: `getDoctorsByClinic`
- Now only returns generalist doctors for the booking flow
- Filters doctors by:
  - `isGeneralist === true`

### 2. UI Display Updates

**File: `app/(patient)/book-visit/index.tsx`**

#### Simplified Clinic Card Display
- **Removed**: Email field from clinic cards
- **Kept**: Clinic name, type, address, and contact number
- **Layout**: Cleaner, more focused display with essential information only

**Before:**
```
Clinic Name
Clinic Type
üìç Address, City, Province ZipCode
üìû Phone Number
üìß Email Address
```

**After:**
```
Clinic Name
Clinic Type
üìç Address, City, Province ZipCode
üìû Phone Number
```

## Benefits

1. **Focused Booking Flow**: Only shows clinics where patients can actually book appointments with generalist doctors
2. **Cleaner UI**: Simplified clinic cards with only essential information
3. **Better User Experience**: No confusion about which clinics have available doctors
4. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed email field that wasn't essential for booking decisions

## Database Impact

- **No structural changes** to existing data
- **Performance**: Additional queries to check for generalist doctors (acceptable for booking flow)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing clinic and doctor data remains unchanged
- **Affiliation Matching**: Handles both clinic IDs and clinic names for doctor affiliations

## Filtering Logic

### Generalist Doctor Detection
A doctor is considered a generalist if they meet this criteria:
1. `isGeneralist` field is `true`

### Clinic Affiliation Matching
The system checks for doctor affiliations using:
1. **Exact clinic ID match**: `doctorData.clinicAffiliations.includes(clinicId)`
2. **Partial name matching**: Checks if clinic name contains or is contained in affiliation
   - Handles cases where doctors are affiliated with clinic names instead of IDs
   - Example: Doctor affiliated with "Metro Cebu Hospital" will match clinic with name "Metro Cebu Hospital"

### Clinic Inclusion Criteria
A clinic is included in the booking flow if it meets ALL criteria:
1. `isActive` is `true`
2. Has valid address (address, city, province all present and non-empty)
3. Has at least one generalist doctor affiliated with it (using flexible affiliation matching)

## Testing Scenarios

- ‚úÖ Clinics with generalist doctors appear in booking flow
- ‚úÖ Clinics without generalist doctors are excluded
- ‚úÖ Clinic cards show only address and phone number
- ‚úÖ Email field is removed from display
- ‚úÖ Address validation still works
- ‚úÖ Generalist doctor filtering works correctly

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/database/firebase.ts`
   - Added `hasGeneralistDoctors` method
   - Modified `getClinics` to filter by generalist availability
   - Modified `getDoctorsByClinic` to only return generalists

2. `app/(patient)/book-visit/index.tsx`
   - Removed email field from clinic card display
   - Simplified clinic details section

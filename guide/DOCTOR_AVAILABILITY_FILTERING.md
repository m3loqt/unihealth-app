# Doctor Availability Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Modified the doctor selection and display to filter out doctors whose availability cannot be fetched, and removed the lastUpdated field from the UI for a cleaner interface.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Service Updates

**File: `src/services/database/firebase.ts`**

#### New Method: `hasValidAvailability`
```typescript
hasValidAvailability(doctorData: any): boolean {
  // Checks if a doctor has valid availability data
  // Returns true if doctor has:
  // - At least one day with enabled schedule and time slots, OR
  // - Specific dates with time slots
}
```

#### Modified Method: `getDoctorsByClinic`
- Now filters out doctors without valid availability data
- Only returns doctors that have at least one available time slot
- Maintains existing generalist and clinic affiliation filtering

#### Modified Method: `getDoctorById`
- Now only returns doctors with valid availability data
- Returns null if doctor doesn't have valid availability

### 2. UI Display Updates

**File: `app/(patient)/book-visit/select-datetime.tsx`**
- **Removed**: Last updated field from doctor info display
- **Result**: Cleaner, more focused doctor information

**File: `app/(patient)/book-visit/select-doctor.tsx`**
- **Removed**: Last updated field from doctor card display
- **Result**: Consistent UI across both screens

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Only shows doctors who actually have available time slots
2. **Cleaner Interface**: Removed unnecessary lastUpdated information
3. **Reduced Confusion**: Users won't see doctors they can't book with
4. **Consistent UI**: Both doctor selection screens now have the same clean layout

## Availability Validation Logic

A doctor is considered to have valid availability if they meet ANY of these criteria:

1. **Weekly Schedule**: At least one day has `enabled: true` and `timeSlots` array with at least one slot
2. **Specific Dates**: At least one specific date has `timeSlots` array with at least one slot

### Examples of Valid Availability:
```json
{
  "availability": {
    "weeklySchedule": {
      "monday": {
        "enabled": true,
        "timeSlots": [{"startTime": "09:00", "endTime": "17:00"}]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Examples of Invalid Availability:
```json
{
  "availability": {
    "weeklySchedule": {
      "monday": {
        "enabled": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Database Impact

- **No structural changes** to existing data
- **Performance**: Slightly faster queries as invalid doctors are filtered out
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing doctor data remains unchanged
- **Data Quality**: Ensures only doctors with actual availability are shown

## Filtering Criteria

A doctor is included in the booking flow if they meet ALL criteria:
1. `isGeneralist` is `true`
2. Has valid clinic affiliation (using flexible matching)
3. Has valid availability data (at least one time slot available)

## Testing Scenarios

- ✅ Doctors with valid availability appear in booking flow
- ✅ Doctors without availability are filtered out
- ✅ Last updated field is removed from both screens
- ✅ UI is cleaner and more focused
- ✅ No errors when trying to book with filtered doctors

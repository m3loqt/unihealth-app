# Available Dates Filter Implementation

## Overview
Modified the date selection to only show dates when the doctor is actually available, improving user experience by preventing selection of unavailable dates.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Service Updates

**File: `src/services/database/firebase.ts`**

#### New Method: `getAvailableDates`
```typescript
async getAvailableDates(doctorId: string, startDate: string, endDate: string): Promise<string[]> {
  // Returns array of date strings (YYYY-MM-DD format) when doctor has availability
  // Checks both weekly schedule and specific dates
  // Only includes dates with actual available time slots
}
```

### 2. UI Component Updates

**File: `app/(patient)/book-visit/select-datetime.tsx`**

#### New State Variables
- `availableDates`: Array of available date strings
- `loadingDates`: Loading state for date availability check

#### New Functions
- `generateAvailableDates()`: Fetches available dates for the next 30 days
- Updated `AVAILABLE_DATES`: Now only includes dates when doctor is available

#### UI Improvements
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner while checking date availability
- **Empty State**: Shows message when no dates are available
- **Filtered Dates**: Only shows dates with actual availability

## How It Works

### Before (Old Logic)
- Showed all dates for the next 30 days
- Users could select any date, even if doctor wasn't available
- Time slots would be empty for unavailable dates

### After (New Logic)
- Only shows dates when doctor has availability
- Checks both weekly schedule and specific dates
- Verifies that time slots are actually available (not fully booked)
- Provides clear feedback when no dates are available

## Availability Check Logic

1. **Date Range**: Checks next 30 days from today
2. **Weekly Schedule**: Checks if doctor works on specific days of the week
3. **Specific Dates**: Checks for special availability on specific dates
4. **Time Slot Verification**: Ensures there are actually available time slots
5. **Booking Conflicts**: Filters out dates with no available slots

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Doctor works Monday-Friday
- **Available**: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- **Not Available**: Saturday, Sunday
- **Result**: Only weekdays shown in date picker

#### Scenario 2: Doctor has specific dates
- **Weekly Schedule**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
- **Specific Date**: 2024-01-15 (Tuesday) - available
- **Result**: Monday, Tuesday (2024-01-15), Wednesday, Friday shown

#### Scenario 3: Fully booked day
- **Weekly Schedule**: Monday available
- **Time Slots**: All slots booked for Monday
- **Result**: Monday not shown in date picker

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can't select unavailable dates
2. **Clear Feedback**: Loading states and empty states provide clear information
3. **Reduced Confusion**: No more empty time slot lists
4. **Efficient Booking**: Users only see actionable dates
5. **Real-time Accuracy**: Reflects actual doctor availability

## Database Impact

- **No structural changes** to existing data
- **Performance**: Additional queries to check availability (acceptable for booking flow)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing doctor availability data continues to work
- **Enhanced Functionality**: More accurate date filtering

## Testing Scenarios

- ✅ Only available dates are shown
- ✅ Loading state appears while checking availability
- ✅ Empty state shows when no dates are available
- ✅ Time slots load correctly for available dates
- ✅ Handles both weekly and specific date schedules
- ✅ Filters out fully booked dates

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/database/firebase.ts`
   - Added `getAvailableDates` method

2. `app/(patient)/book-visit/select-datetime.tsx`
   - Added available dates state management
   - Updated date generation logic
   - Added loading and empty states
   - Updated UI to show filtered dates

## Usage Examples

### For Doctors
Doctors can set their availability:
```json
{
  "availability": {
    "weeklySchedule": {
      "monday": { "enabled": true, "timeSlots": [...] },
      "wednesday": { "enabled": true, "timeSlots": [...] },
      "friday": { "enabled": true, "timeSlots": [...] }
    },
    "specificDates": {
      "2024-01-15": { "timeSlots": [...] }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Patients
Patients will only see available dates:
- Monday, Wednesday, Friday (from weekly schedule)
- January 15, 2024 (from specific dates)
- No Saturday/Sunday or other unavailable days

This ensures a much better booking experience with clear availability information.
